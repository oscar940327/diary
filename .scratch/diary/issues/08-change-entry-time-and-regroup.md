# 08 — Change Entry Time and regroup history

**What to build:** Let the owner move an Entry to the intended date and time while preserving the distinction between metadata and Original Content. The Entry moves across history and calendar groups without creating a content revision.

**Blocked by:** 04 — Browse continuous bidirectional history.

**Status:** ready-for-agent

- [x] The owner can edit Entry Time through an explicit Entry action.
- [x] A valid change updates Entry metadata without creating or changing an Entry Revision.
- [x] Immutable capture time remains unchanged and is distinguishable from Entry Time.
- [x] The Entry disappears from its former date group and appears in the correct new `Asia/Taipei` group.
- [x] Calendar presence or counts update for both affected dates.
- [x] History cursor ordering remains correct after moving an Entry across a date or across an equal timestamp.
- [x] Invalid timestamps are rejected without partial changes.
- [x] Changing Entry Time alone does not invalidate or regenerate AI interpretation of unchanged Original Content.
- [x] System and browser tests cover same-day changes, cross-day moves, timezone boundaries, and unchanged revision count.

## Comments

### 2026-08-04 - Ticket 08 implementation complete

#### Fixed review bases and preflight

- Diary review base:
  `898a6056068ce282e36399d568ea6350bb413f29`.
- Personal Website review base:
  `231ebe21ed09ec7d777f3c78ed6eb58aab396962`.
- Ticket 07's fixed-range review is recorded as `PASSED`, with no blocking
  Standards or Spec finding.
- Both repositories were clean on `main`, their HEADs exactly matched the
  fixed review bases, and they matched `origin/main` before Ticket 08 began.
- Latest required GitHub Actions were green at both bases:
  - Diary `Backend checks`, run
    [30763641174](https://github.com/oscar940327/diary/actions/runs/30763641174).
  - Personal Website `Website checks and Pages`, run
    [30762095151](https://github.com/oscar940327/my-personal-website/actions/runs/30762095151),
    and `pages build and deployment`, run
    [30762094606](https://github.com/oscar940327/my-personal-website/actions/runs/30762094606).

#### TDD evidence

- Backend action red: the new real-system metadata-only test reached
  Supabase, PostgREST and Uvicorn, then received HTTP `404 Not Found` because
  `/entries/{entry_id}/entry-time` did not exist.
- History snapshot red: after moving an Entry already returned on page one,
  the existing cursor returned it again on page two because v4 froze Entry
  membership but not its ordering position.
- Browser red: the real mobile Chromium journey completed Magic Link sign-in,
  capture, edit and restore, then timed out waiting for the missing
  `Change Entry Time` Entry action.
- Backend green: the complete Ticket 08 focused system set passed `9 passed`,
  and the ordered Ticket 04-08 History, Calendar and Revision regression set
  passed `33 passed`.
- Browser green: the real Supabase/Auth/PostgreSQL/PostgREST/Uvicorn/Vite
  mobile Chromium journey changed Entry Time across a date, regrouped
  History, preserved Captured time and kept all three revisions unchanged.

#### Implementation and boundaries

- Ordered expand-contract migration
  `20260804120000_change_entry_time_and_stabilize_history.sql` adds the
  owner-token, RLS-enforced atomic Entry Time RPC and a snapshot-visible
  metadata position history. The latter versions only History ordering
  positions and never creates or changes an Entry Revision.
- History v5 chooses the Entry Time position visible to the cursor snapshot,
  so a concurrent move cannot duplicate a visited Entry or omit an unvisited
  Entry. Fresh History, Calendar and direct Entry reads use the current
  `entry_at`, with microsecond ordering and UUID equal-time tie-breaking.
- FastAPI rejects invalid, missing or offsetless timestamps before mutation.
  The database RPC independently requires an explicit offset, and direct
  owner-token table PATCH of `entry_at` or immutable `created_at` remains
  denied. FastAPI authorization and forced PostgreSQL RLS remain independent
  defenses.
- The frontend exposes a separate `Change Entry Time` action and dialog that
  explicitly distinguishes Entry Time, Captured time and Original Content
  revisions. A successful change regroups local History, refreshes from a new
  snapshot, refreshes Calendar data and preserves the active reading anchor.
- Revision identities, revision rows, immutable revision capture times,
  Original Content and the existing AI processing obligation remain byte-for-
  byte unchanged; no obligation is staled or created.
- Personal Website implementation commit:
  `3d1e27ea3d78eb20d44b1ef0a63defd64f0dd1b5`.
- Diary GitHub Actions now pins that exact reviewed frontend implementation
  commit, so the repositories must be pushed in Personal Website, then Diary
  order.
- No new Supabase, GitHub or Azure environment variable is required. No secret
  was added to frontend code or Git.
- Ticket 09, Trash, permanent deletion, AI Draft generation, Queue
  publication, RAG and Agent work were not started.
- This implementation session did not run code review and did not push either
  repository.

#### Full verification

- Diary: `python -m mypy src tests` passed; `python -m pytest -q` passed
  `75 passed` with one existing Starlette/httpx deprecation warning. The full
  suite reset and migrated the real local Supabase database and included the
  real mobile Chromium journey.
- Personal Website: `npm.cmd run typecheck` passed; the complete four-spec
  Playwright set passed all `21` Chromium tests with four workers;
  `npm.cmd run build` and `npm.cmd run verify:build` passed.
- On this Windows checkout, the nested `npm.cmd test` wrapper displayed all
  `21` tests as `ok` but did not return after Playwright's reusable local Vite
  server teardown. Running the same complete spec set directly through
  `npm.cmd run test:e2e -- <all four spec files>` returned exit code zero.
